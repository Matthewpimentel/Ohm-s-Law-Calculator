# Ohm's Law Calculator
# Description
This project is an Ohm's Law Calculator built using python and tkinter. You must input two known values such as Current and Voltage and the program will provide you with the rest of the values.
# Challenges
The big challenge I faced was input validations to make sure the user can't input a letter instead of a number.
# Installation
To install please download the EXECUTABLE file and unzip it into a file and run the .exe.
